The Waveshare display convieniently fits inside the front skirts of a Voron 350 machine using Voron 250 Front skirts.
This design replaces the Front Center Skirt. There is no need to cantilever this display since it sits below the door panels and even with the structure its sitting on.
I included a power switch with an integrated red light on the left front to indicate the unit is on. 
No reaching around the back to turn it on or off. Although the display is a good indicator its ON.

The display is a 7.9inch Capacitive Touch Screen LCD, 400Ã—1280, HDMI, IPS, Toughened Glass Cover.
Supports a RaspberryPi3 or 4 directly on the back. Very convienient for this application.
I added a fan to the Pi just in case.
